Blackjack:

Goal: 
- Simulate a blackjack game with basic stategy 
- Display probabilities for the house/player to win in a given state

Possible functionalities:
- Simulate random playing bot vs a basic stategy bot 
- Given that we know the state of the deck, how can we use this to improve our probabilties of winning 
- Simulator game which trains a person into memorising basic stategy  

What do we need:
--- Card class ---
--- Deck class ---

- player class, not sure if nessesary, but seems natural to have
- A game loop
 

- Some object keping track of the basic stategy(just do dict, with function?)
- Functions to compute probabilities 

- Web interface where a user can plot in the state of a game, then get the basic strategy answer back from it
